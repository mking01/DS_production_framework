# Coronavirus Predictions - Production DS Project

# Goal
The goal of this project is to practice coding for data science production projects.  This includes:
- building a framework
- connecting files to one another
- constructing modularized code
- using pipelines to process and model data for simplicity and maintainability
- practice creating unit tests

The problem solved in this project is predicting which patients test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea.

# Data
Data for this project is pulled from an open source dataset provided by the Korean Center for Disease Control.  It is available on Github here: https://github.com/jihoo-kim/Coronavirus-Dataset.

# Folders
data: stores all data files (in real life, data would likely be pulled in through a cloud or database connection)
notebooks: stores all notebooks used for analysis and data discovery
src: all source code used for production
src / scripts:  all production .py scripts
src / configs: all changeable components for the project (e.g. file paths)
src / lib: contains module created for the project
tests: contains all tests used to check code and data for the project, such as unit tests
documentation: contains all notes about the project, the code, and the problem context
